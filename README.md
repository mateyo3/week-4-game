# The Anbu Mask Game
Based on the Crystal Game (week-4-game)

## Functionality
When the application begins the computer randomly chooses a host character from an array. Each host image is connected to their name, which changes in the DOM.

Each Anbu mask is randomly assigned a value from 2-12. The user clicks on each mask to add to their total. 

If the user matches the host's number, then the wins total increases by one. If the user's total is greater than the host's number the loss total increases by one.
